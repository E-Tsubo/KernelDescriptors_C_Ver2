※
Dependences Eigen3, OpenCV2.3.0, libmatio
Please install those library before compile this program.

※
This Code is remaked of original code "KernelDescriptors_CPU_v1_2".
At libkerneldesc, I add eval_kernel_matlab function.
This is compartible for matlab code. Use this function!!.
And, kernelmain support GradientKdes and RGBKdes for RGB Image.
Now, doesn't support depth image, kinect sensor and others features.
Finally, add liblinear function in order to predict.
I make GetObjectName_liblinear function. Please use this function!!.
